# Sales Prediction Using Python

## 📈 Overview
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, considering factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. In businesses offering products or services, Data Scientists play a crucial role in predicting future sales. They utilize machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, enabling informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about historical sales data, including advertising expenditure, target audience demographics, and sales figures.

## 🛠️ Requirements
To run the code for this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- Pandas 🐼
- NumPy 🔢
- Scikit-learn 🧠

## 📝 Usage & Settings
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Explore techniques to create or transform features to improve model performance.
3. **Model Building**: Choose an appropriate regression technique (e.g., linear regression, random forest regression) and train the model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new sales data.
